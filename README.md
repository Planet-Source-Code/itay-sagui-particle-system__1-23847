## Particle System


</div>

### Description

This program was created in the beginning as a request of Kamilche (look for her on PSC). It emulate different types of particle systems like rain, snow, explosions, fountains. I also added the ability to handle single particles, and a special "repulsion" particle.

The program takes in account gravitional forces and wind into its calculations, which makes it as realistic as can be.

Note that this program is not finished, and I posted it here so someone else will finish it. I'm ready to answer any question that you want to ask. I would like to see the program as some king of graphic program, which let the user create a text output for predefined particles in his program, or let the useer create a movie/images as he desires.

Just let me know how things are going and some credits (and votes) will be welcome.
